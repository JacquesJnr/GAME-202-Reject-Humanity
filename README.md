#### **Abstract:**

Make monkey noises! Stomp your feet! Beat your chest! `APE OUT!` You are a monkey and you cannot be contained! Your howling and stomping will be your control input for this game.

#### **Components:**

+ **Piezo Elements** - To sense any stoping on the floor
+ **Copper Tape** - For capacitive touch
+ **Microphone** - To sense any monkey noises
+ **Monkey costume** - To attatch components to the player.

#### **The Game:**

My goal for this game is for the player to behave like a monkey for a little while and take their mind off the daily struggles of humanity. The game will be developed in the **Unity engine** and will display a **progress bar** to represent the player transitioning from humanity and returning to monkey. In order for the player to fill this bar up, they must stomp their feet, bang their chest and make lots of noise. The player will stand on top of some kind of platform where they will assume the role of a monkey. The platform will have **piezo elements** attached to detect vibration caused by the players' feet. There will also be a **microphone** to detect the ***"monkey noises"*** made by the player and some **copper tape** to detect capacitive touch on the players chest when they bang on it (or touch it at the very least). Performing all these actions at once will fill the progress bar, effectively turning the player into a monkey, winning the game!
